              Lan Kyone is where all began for InnovatoryMM, my startup
              adventure. It&apos;s a simple ride-sharing platform designed with
              university students in mind, by university students. This
              brainchild of ours made quite a splash, bagging the first
              runner-up spot in the Unihack Challenge 2018 and taking home the
              gold in the Tech for Life category at the Phandeeyar Startup
              Challenge.
            </p>
            <p className="my-8">
              Our journey even got some social media buzz and media coverage!
              But, you know, those were the days when giants like Grab and Uber
              ruled the ride-sharing realm. Lan Kyone put up a good fight, but
              when Grab introduced their GrabShare feature, well, it was a tough
              game.

              Our development team consisted of just two devs, and I am proud to
              say that I was in charge of all front-end aspects; the app, the
              landing pages and more! Oh, did I forget to mention that our
              blockchain-themed election system app for Yangon Technological
              Univesity Student Union got endorsed by a majority of members and
              selected for implementation?

              period. The platform got regarded as one of the top choices by the
              AV professionals! However, it has ended services around June 2023
              but still great to be part of the great journey!

              forecast app to code challenges that keep me on my toes.
              You&apos;ll find ThreeJS experiments like mesmerizing sunsets,
              glimpses of past portfolio designs, and CSS experiments that play
              with visual flair. There are even some personal lovey-dovey

              Welcome to the Legacy Projects series, where I take you back to
              the good ol&apos; days before my professional dev career began.
              This is where my coding journey kicked off.
            </p>
            <p className="my-8">
              Back then, I had got my hands on a variety of languages before I
              focused on front end - a Cookie Clicker clone using Java (which
              brought a really big wow factor among my class!), a Mobile Money
              platform and a cinema booking system using PHP, mostly for
              educational assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then there&apos;s the Minecraft plugins, a bit of my gaming past,
              which unfortunately have gone into the digital abyss since I had
              yet to discover GitHub back then. These projects are like my own
              personal time capsule, reminding me of how far I&apos;ve come
              since those early days of coding exploration.
